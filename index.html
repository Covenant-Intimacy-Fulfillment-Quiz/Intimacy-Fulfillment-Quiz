    cautions:`Cautions: Your strong need for fun and validation can sometimes feel overwhelming for a partner with a quieter temperament. If you don't feel like your energy is being matched, you might become restless or discouraged.`,
    try:`Try This: Make a point to balance your playful energy with moments of quiet, calm connection. Instead of waiting for others to guess what you need, practice asking for affirmation directly. It's perfectly okay to say, "I'd really love to hear something encouraging right now."`

    try:`Try This: Challenge yourself to add more specificity to your affirmations.

/* Communication styles — definitions + strategies per spec */

You might withhold your opinions and feelings to prevent disagreement, which can sometimes lead to resentment or emotional distance building up over time.`,
    move: `For the Passive Communicator: Start by taking small steps to voice your opinions and needs. Instead of saying, "Whatever you want to do is fine," try, "I'd actually prefer to go to the movies tonight, how does that sound to you?"`
  },
  "Aggressive": {
    copy: `Your results indicate a strong tendency toward an aggressive communication style. This approach is direct and forceful, and you may find yourself dominating conversations or interrupting others to push your own perspective. This style is often linked to a desire for control and can leave others feeling unheard or overpowered. The goal is to learn to express your needs powerfully while also creating space for others to share theirs.`,
    move: `For the Aggressive Communicator: Practice using "I" statements instead of "you" statements. For example, change "You always interrupt me" to "I feel unheard when I'm interrupted." This shifts the focus from blame to personal experience.`
  },
  "Passive-Aggressive": {
    copy: `Based on your assessment, you lean toward a passive-aggressive communication style. This can show up as sarcasm, giving the silent treatment, or making subtle jabs instead of being direct about what you need. This style can be especially damaging because it combines hostility with avoidance, leaving issues unresolved and creating frustration for everyone involved. A great next step is to practice being more direct and open in your conversations.`,
    move: `For the Passive-Aggressive Communicator: Be direct. When you feel frustrated, instead of making a sarcastic comment, try saying, "I'm feeling frustrated right now because of X." This allows for an honest conversation rather than a hidden conflict.`
  },
  "Avoidant / Withdrawn": {
    copy: `Your results suggest you often use an avoidant/withdrawn communication style. When things get difficult, you might find yourself shutting down, disengaging, or "stonewalling" during conversations. This style is common when people feel overwhelmed or are trying to avoid conflict entirely. It can prevent issues from being resolved and create emotional distance. Learning to stay present in difficult conversations is a great place to start.`,
    move: `For the Avoidant/Withdrawn Communicator: Learn to manage your overwhelm by taking a short break. Say, "I'm feeling overwhelmed right now. Can we talk about this in 15 minutes?" This is a much healthier alternative to stonewalling, as it communicates a clear intention to return to the conversation.`
  },
  "Assertive": {
    copy: `Congratulations! Your assessment shows you have a strong assertive communication style. This is considered the healthiest approach, as you are able to clearly and respectfully express your needs while also genuinely respecting the other person's perspective. This balanced style builds trust and intimacy because it blends honesty with empathy. Keep up the great work!`,
    move: `For the Assertive Communication: Balance your style with the other healthy style, Collaborative / Empathetic Communication. This is a strengths-based approach where you actively listen, validate others' feelings, and work together to solve problems. It's very similar to assertive communication but has an even stronger focus on cooperation and understanding. This style helps build strong, intimate relationships.`

      <p>Our model organizes intimacy into 12 distinct types that span all dimensions of human experience, wisely combining the essential aspects of 'being together' (like emotional bonding and spiritual connection) and 'doing together' (like shared effort and practical unity). This approach reflects how love truly thrives in real-life marriage. These types represent crucial points of connection (and sometimes conflict) in your relationship, and understanding your preferences gives you and your spouse a shared language to express your needs and navigate your connection.

          <p>The most successful couples consistently demonstrate a blend of assertive and collaborative/empathetic communication. While these are often discussed as two separate styles, they are deeply intertwined and represent a healthy, proactive approach to communication.</p>
          <p><em>Assertive communication</em> is about clearly and respectfully expressing your own needs, feelings, and boundaries without attacking or blaming your partner. It's the "I feel..." statement—taking ownership of your emotions and needs, which prevents defensiveness and opens the door for a productive conversation.</p>
          <p><em>Collaborative/empathetic communication</em> involves actively listening and seeking to understand your partner's perspective. This style goes beyond simply hearing words; it's about validating their emotions, even if you don't agree with their viewpoint. This creates a safe space for both partners to be vulnerable and understood.</p>
          <p>When these two styles are combined, they form a powerful feedback loop. One partner asserts their needs, and the other responds with empathy and a collaborative mindset, and vice versa. This dynamic builds a strong foundation of trust and intimacy, allowing couples to navigate disagreements and challenges as a team rather than as opponents.</p>
