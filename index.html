    express:`Expressing Love: You're a natural at bringing joy and playfulness into a relationship. Your affection is lighthearted, and you show you care by creating fun moments and lifting the mood. Your actions say, "I'm with you, and life is simply better because we're together."`,
    feel:`Feeling Most Loved: You feel most cherished when the love you give is returned with the same energy and enthusiasm. Laughter, consistent closeness, and affirmation make you feel truly adored and seen.`,
    cautions:`Cautions: Your strong need for fun and validation can sometimes feel overwhelming for a partner with a quieter temperament. If you don't feel like your energy is being matched, you might become restless or discouraged.`,
    try:`Try This: Make a point to balance your playful energy with moments of quiet, calm connection. Instead of waiting for others to guess what you need, practice asking for affirmation directly. It's perfectly okay to say, "I'd really love to hear something encouraging right now."`
  },
  S: { heading:"Choleric",
    express:`Expressing Love: You show love through action and initiative. For you, love is a verb. You care for your partner by taking charge—solving problems, creating plans, and protecting the things that matter most to them.`,
    feel:`Feeling Most Loved: You feel deeply honored when your partner steps in to help with a practical task or takes a burden off your shoulders. Acts of service and practical support speak louder than words to you.`,
    cautions:`Cautions: Because you're so action-oriented, you might overlook the need for softer, more emotional connection. This can lead to your partner feeling loved through your actions but not necessarily through tenderness or verbal affection.`,
    try:`Try This: Practice pairing your strong actions with a few simple, verbal affirmations. For example, after you fix something for your partner, you could say, "I did this for you because you're important to me."`
  },
  R: { heading:"Melancholy",
    express:`Expressing Love: You express your love through deep thought and meaningful presence. For you, a heartfelt conversation and thoughtful words are the truest forms of affection.`,
    feel:`Feeling Most Loved: You feel most secure when your partner takes the time to truly listen to you. Engaging in a reflective, heart-to-heart dialogue makes you feel understood and deeply cared for.`,
    cautions:`Cautions: Your high standards for yourself and others can sometimes make your partner feel like they can't measure up. Your tendency to over-analyze can also leave you feeling misunderstood if your partner can't follow your line of thought.`,
    try:`Try This: Actively communicate your appreciation, not just your concerns. When you're sharing a thought or a concern, try to add a feeling statement alongside it. For example, "I feel cared for when you listen to me so carefully," rather than just "You're a good listener."`
  },
  A: { heading:"Phlegmatic",
    express:`Expressing Love: You show love through your calm and steady presence. Your peaceful tone, gentle touch, and quiet demeanor make your partner feel safe and secure.`,
    feel:`Feeling Most Loved: You feel most cared for when your partner provides a gentle, consistent presence without any pressure. You thrive on a calm, low-key connection that feels reliable and safe.`,
    cautions:`Cautions: Your tendency to avoid conflict can cause you to hide your own needs until they build up into quiet resentment. This can prevent a healthy resolution of issues and leave you feeling unheard.`,
    try:`Try This: Challenge yourself to choose one small need each week to voice clearly and directly. For example, you could say, "It would mean a lot to me if we could have a quiet night in this weekend."`

  U: { heading:"Supine",
    express:`Expressing Love: You express your love through consistent service and reliability. Your actions speak volumes, and your message to your partner is always, "You're not alone—I'm with you and I'll be there for you."`,
    feel:`Feeling Most Loved: You feel truly valued when your partner notices your sacrifices, offers to help you in return, and verbally affirms your loyalty and commitment.`,
    cautions:`Cautions: You may have a tendency to suppress your own needs, silently hoping that others will notice what you need without you having to ask. When this goes unrecognized, it can lead to quiet hurt and feeling taken for granted.`,
    try:`Try This: Practice stating a need directly and without apology. It can be as simple as saying, "I'd like to get some rest tonight, so I can't help with that right now." This builds respect and is essential for preventing burnout.`

    cautions:`Cautions: When affirmation comes so naturally, it's easy to take that consistency for granted. You might fall into the trap of using general praise instead of specific, meaningful words.`,
    try:`Try This: Challenge yourself to add more specificity to your affirmations. Instead of simply saying, "Thanks for doing that," try something like, "I really appreciate how you handled that conversation; it showed so much wisdom and care."

    cautions:`Cautions: If left unspoken, this lack of recognition can create significant emotional distance and resentment, making it feel like you are not on the same side.`,
    try:`Try This: It's time to have a gentle but honest conversation. Approach your partner by sharing your feelings using "I" statements.

    try:`Try This: In moments of tension, ask for one clear reassurance from your partner. Then, agree to a short reset with a promised return time. You might say, "Can you just tell me you love me right now? I need twenty minutes to calm down, but I promise I'll be back to talk about this then." This gives both of you what you need.`

    result:`Your Result: Your connection style values clarity and personal reflection. You have a natural tendency to de-escalate conflict by stepping back to think carefully.`,
